## Details
### You will learn
 - NEW Capabilities of SAP HANA Cockpit related to SAP HANA Dynamic Tiering
 - Checking the `Esserver` Status to see if Dynamic Tiering is active
 - Checking Coordinator Types to see if extended storage is running and created


[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 1: ](Checking the Status of the Esserver)]
One of the most important things to be validated once your Dynamic Tiering node is installed is to see whether everything is up and running. The `esserver` is the Dynamic Tiering server process. If the `esserver` is running, it means the Dynamic Tiering environment is active and running.

[DONE]

[ACCORDION-BEGIN [Step 2: ](Checking Different Services)]
The `M_SERVICES` view enables a user to identify the coordinator type for the `esserver`. There are three different coordinator types that you might see beside your `esserver`.
